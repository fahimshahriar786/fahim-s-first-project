            <h3>Hello </h3>
            <p>I’m Fahim Shahriar. I’m a designer who codes. I'm also the author of Laying the Foundations (a book about
                design systems, web design, and product design). I’ve worked internationally, in-house, and remotely on
                projects for leading brands, agencies, startups, and charities. I care deeply about creating
                world-class,
                useful, and beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I can be as involved in your
                project
                as you need me to be; from the seed of the idea, to sketches, creative direction, design, copywriting,
                system design, and even the front-end and WordPress build.</p>
